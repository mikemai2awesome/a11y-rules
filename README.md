# AI Web Development Rules

A collection of rules (or instructions) for AI assistants to write better, more accessible HTML and CSS.

## Key Principles

- **Accessibility First**: All code should meet WCAG 2.2 standards
- **Semantic HTML**: Use meaningful HTML elements that convey structure and purpose
- **Modern CSS**: Leverage CSS cascade layers, logical properties, and relative units
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build with vanilla JavaScript and focus on core functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Use relative units and flexible layouts

## Usage

1. Copy the text in the `rules.md`
2. Paste the text into the rules (or instructions) input within your AI tool of choice (e.g. Cursor, Windsurf, Claude, etc.)
3. Depending on your needs, you could re-organize the rules into user rules and project specific rules

## Tips

- Even with these specific rules, AI can still make mistakes. Always consult an accessibility expert to review your code.
- Whenever you know of a proven accessible example, try to add it as a context when prompting.
- Save WCAG and ARIA docs as PDFs and attach them as the knowledge for the AI.
